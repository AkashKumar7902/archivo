# Event Log of different changes in the Data

## Hard rising in february/march in ontology numbers

The reason for the hard increase in additions is the fixing of a bug in the SPO implementation which used to kill the process after a few URIs. 
The increase continues over the next few weeks since the newly added ontologies are the source of more discoveries and so on.


## Avg star rating increases to > 2.0

Main reason is the inclusion of many old ontology versions of the http://purl.allotrope.org domain, which are mostly correctly deployed and licensed. Unfortunately they version their ontologies in the NIR, so every new version results in a seperate artifact.
